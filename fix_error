Note for future
--
If you need to have qt first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/qt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find qt you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/qt/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/qt/include"

6. 
$ cd /usr/local/opt/qt/bin/
$./qmake -project /Users/dlee/spike-sorting/extract

7. cd to /extract/
$make
